## Installation

Simply install to your project:

```bash
sampctl package install LashaKanteladze/Nex-AC
```

Now you have to open **nex-ac.inc** from *dependencies/Nex-AC* directory and include which language you want under the line 19.

For instance 
```pawn
#include 	<lang\nex-ac_ge.lang>
```
It would look like this
```pawn
#if !defined DEBUG
	#define DEBUG
	#include 	<lang\nex-ac_ge.lang>
#endif
```

Otherwise Nex-AC will use its default language (English).


Then you have to include Nex-AC like this
```pawn
#include <nex-ac>
```

# Multilingual:
The script can be configured at any of the available languages. To do it, just download the desired localization, save it in a directory with the main include *(nex_ac.inc)* and recompile your script.

##### *It is also recommended to check on use any other anti-cheats in order to avoid conflicts with them.*

# Installation:
1. Download version of the anticheat which compatible with the version of your server
2. Download the language file *(.lang)* in your preferred language
3. Copy both files to a folder *"/pawno/include"* which is located in the folder with the server
4. In gamemode and all filterscripts after *#include "a_samp"* write the following: *#include "nex-ac"*  
***Warning! If you use Streamer Plugin by Incognito, Timerfix plugin by Dan, foreach, sscanf or y_hooks, include it before nex-ac!***  
*Also keep in mind that filterscript must have "#define FILTERSCRIPT" before including anticheat*
5. Compile the modified scripts

*Do you get an error when you compiling this anticheat with YSI? Check out [some tips](http://forum.sa-mp.com/showpost.php?p=3556462&postcount=202)*
