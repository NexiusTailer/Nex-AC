[Example of setting **OnCheatDetected** in your gamemode](CHANGELOG.md)

# Multilingual:
The script can be configured in any of the available languages. To do it, just download the desired localization, save it in a directory with the main include *(nex_ac.inc)* and recompile your script.

* *.lang* files can be opened even in default notepad and easily edited

*Did not find your language? Help the project* :)  
If you know well a language that is not in the "lang" folder, please translate anticheat into this language. To do this, just send the translated .lang file via Pull Request.  
I will be very glad of your help and add you in the list of those who helped the development of the anticheat.

# Installation:
1. Download latest anticheat version from the repo
2. Download the language file *(.lang)* in your preferred language
3. Copy both files to a folder *"/pawno/include"* which is located in a folder with the server
4. In your gamemode, after *#include <a_samp>* write the following:
```pawn
#define DEBUG
#include <nex-ac_en.lang> //or any other
#include <nex-ac>
```
5. In all filterscripts, after *#include <a_samp>* write the following:
```pawn
#include <nex-ac>
```
6. Compile the modified scripts

***Warnings:***
 * Check for using any other anticheats in order to avoid conflicts with them
 * If you use Streamer Plugin by Incognito, Pawn.RakNet, foreach, sscanf, YSF or SKY, include it before nex-ac
 * Some libraries like fixes, mdialog or tdw_dialog may also require to be included before nex-ac
 * Keep in mind that filterscript must have "#define FILTERSCRIPT" before including the anticheat
